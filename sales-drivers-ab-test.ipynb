    "# Using Hypothesis Testing to Understand Drivers of Sales\n",

    "We were contracted by an e-commerce marketplace to help them understand what factors drive sales. They collected data on 10,0000 purchases recently made, including how much time was spent on the page, how many reviews the product had, and the product rating. They wanted to understand what factors in their data are driving sales. \n",
